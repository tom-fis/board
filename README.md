Background - A New Player in the Streaming Industry

Stadia was launched to the public on November 19th, 2019, representing Google's attempt to break into the gaming industry1,8​​​​​​​. The service was an early adopter of the streaming centric product model - a software application "capable of streaming video games to players at up to 4K resolution at 60 frames per second (FPS) .. via the company's numerous data centers."8 In short, the application allowed users to circumvent the traditional gaming structure of hardware dependency, offering a service that allowed them to play games without regard for hardware specifications. Additionally, Stadia offered "instant-on game play without downloads," circumventing the need to install the application on a local machine3. Consumers could play technological advanced and demanding games on their personal computers via Chrome, on Chromebooks, or on Android smartphones1,3,8. This service type is referred to loosely as 'cloud gaming', or 'gaming on demand', or 'gaming-as-a-service'8,9. 

This technology requires significant backend infrastructure. The burden falls on the provider to develop and maintain "data centers and server farms, [as well as] high-bandwidth internet connections with low latency for delivering the streams to users."9 Google, with the company's incredibly deep pockets and robust technological backbone, was well poised to break into the industry from both an infrastructure and engineering perspective. Even so, after 3 years, Google made the announcement that Stadia would be discontinued and fully disassembled in early 20231,2,4​​​​​​​. See the blog post announcement attached at the bottom of this page (#2). 

What caused the Stadia product to fail? Why did a company so well poised to put this product to market flounder? How did external factors affect this decision? What did they do right and wrong, and what can other companies learn from the Stadia product? 

Stadia's Value Proposition

Arguably the most important item to address in Stadia's lifecycle is the value proposition at the core of the product. Stadia asked users not only to subscribe to the service for a monthly fee, but also purchase the games within the service at full price. For a community (the gaming community) that is vocally opposed to software-as-a-service (SaaS), this was an unpalatable request. Even without feelings held towards SaaS business models, users could simply purchase the game at full price through another platform and own it permanently. The value proposition involved purchasing not only a subscription, but also access to the game, without any real sense of ownership. Stadia changed direction in April 2020, offering a free subscription tier in addition to the 'pro' tier. This limited streaming capabilities but did not require a subscription8. The value of the product, at its core, was a gaming experience that did not require the high buy-in cost of hardware. The idea that consumers could play their games anywhere was simply not enough to gain traction. In a market in which most gamers already own consoles or PCs, and where the competition of gaming marketplaces is steep, the value proposition was simply too low. 

External Market Conditions

External market conditions were favorable for Stadia's success. Shortly after the release of Stadia, the COVID-19 pandemic took the world by storm, forcing consumers to stay at home and find entertainment conducive to the new normal. Other platforms, such as Steam, showed record breaking statistics for peak players and purchases11. The increase in desire for gaming products should create a space ripe for Stadia's success. However, the selling point of 'play anywhere' was slightly diminished with consumers spending more time at home.

Similarly, 2020 and 2021 saw a dramatic graphics processing unit (GPU) shortage, relating to global supply chain issues, new uses in cryptocurrency mining, and a shortage of microchips11. GPUs are central to PC gaming, and shortages were experienced by consumers along the entire spectrum of GPU offerings. Not only did demand skyrocket, but average price increased dramatically as well. The end result was a market that nearly quadrupled, with a Q1 increase in revenue (for GPU manufacturers) by 370% in 202112. The average price of a GPU was simply not feasible for most people, especially at the top of the line, which should have increased demand for a hardware independent gaming experience. 

Additionally, the demand for consoles and subsequent shortages should have created a situation in which Stadia would be well placed to thrive. The release of the next generation console offerings (PS5 & Xbox Series X) was plagued by high demand and low supply13. Consumers were unable to buy the new consoles due to the chip shortage13 and pervasive scalping/price-gouging. This, too, should have bolstered the niche Stadia claimed to fill. Even so, Stadia underperformed compared to expectations and continued to decline in popularity despite a market that appeared ripe for the taking3.

Takeaway

The Good

Google's deep pockets and considerable engineering talent pool allowed for a strong technological footing for the Stadia application. Users were generally pleased with the performance and features of the product. It's well known that Google has strong incentives and attracts some of the strongest engineering talent, and this was certainly reflected in overall product quality. 
As an extension of the first point, Google's omniscient presence as a service provider allowed Stadia to benefit from a mature technological infrastructure. This strong background reduced Google's time to get an MVP to market and allowed the client's server-side performance to be reliable and efficient. 
It cannot be ignored that Stadia had some interesting technology. It was, by definition, a disruptive innovator. The hardware independent, play anywhere model was not widely available at the time and Google leveraged their deep pool of resources to make that a reality. Additionally, some features of Stadia were, to put it in layman's terms, really cool. One such feature was 'state share,' in which users could share their save state of the game (their current game instance) with another player and that player could simply pick up where they left off with a few button clicks8.
Google also created their own hardware, the Stadia game controller, which could connect with the various stadia supported devices to allow for more flexibility from PCs or Android phones. This also gave the company an additional revenue stream that leveraged an already established product8.
Upon announcing the sunset of Stadia, Google pledged to refund hardware and all games purchased from the Stadia store. This will go a long way towards rebuilding trust with consumers who were skeptical of the product and Google's intentions since product inception3,4,8​​​​​​,14.
The Bad

As mentioned above, the value proposition was too low for the product offering. While Google did reverse course with a free offering, the idea of purchasing rights to play a game on the cloud, without a concept of true ownership, was not appetizing enough for consumers. Additionally, there has been significant backlash against SaaS among the gaming community, and that shows in Stadia's product performance. 
The value proposition was not significantly augmented by exclusives. Exclusive games developed for Stadia could have given the product the bump it needed to stay relevant. It's always clearer in hindsight, but Google did not invest significantly in additional features that would augment the value proposition. 
There were concerns about Stadia from the consumer perspective before the product was released. Consumers were vocal about why they would or would not use Stadia - and Google could have responded better to accommodate their clientele. Considering how much of FIS' focus is on client excellence, this is a lesson that FIS management already understands - but the importance of listening to the consumer's needs cannot be overlooked.
For a multitude of reasons, Stadia failed to compete with not only with other game streaming services, but also with other online game storefronts. Considering the matured market of the latter Google attempted to step into, this was a miscalculation on the part of the product team. Simply innovating, in this case, was not enough to keep the product alive.
Despite low trust from consumers in terms of breaking into the gaming market, Google has not risen to the challenge to build client trust. If anything, the expectation is that consumers will be even more hesitant to buy-in to Google gaming products in the future. Stadia started on rocky footing, and consumer trust has continued to decline throughout the product lifecycle. 
The Ugly

While Google has attempted to rebuild trust with consumers with full refunds, the same courtesy was not given to developers working on Stadia exclusives. According to Forbes, Stadia's shutdown caught many developers who had deals with Stadia off guard. Many learned of the shutdown at the same time as the public5. It is unclear how Google will honor their financial obligations to said developers, but the lack of communication further erodes trust with game developers, who had previously seen Stadia as a developer friendly platform in terms of percentage cuts. 
Wired reported that, as per a communication between a Google Stadia product employee and an independent developer, that the product team found out about the closure at the same time as the developers, with the release of the blog post detailing Stadia's closure15. 
The above shows a salient lack of coordination in terms of strategic vision between upper management and Stadia's product team. This lack of coordination not only casts doubt among developers working on exclusives for Stadia, but among consumers as well. A clear strategic direction and communication with clients is integral for product success. 
Despite external market conditions conducive to success, Stadia was unable to capitalize on what seems like a great market opportunity.
Assumptions and Limitations

Only US debit data considered. 
Graphs of US debit data were not included due to the very low volume related to Stadia purchases in the weeks leading up to the announcement. This makes sense as to why the product was eventually shutdown. Comparative graphs with other competitors were similarly not valuable in that Stadia purchases amounted to a couple hundred a day in low amounts. 
Stadia purchases were considered under string match and SIC codes 5734, 5818, 5817.
